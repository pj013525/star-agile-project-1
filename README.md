### âœ… Next Steps for You:

1. **Create `images/` folder** inside the repo  
2. Upload screenshots:
   - Jenkins Dashboard
   - Docker Container running
   - Prometheus Targets Page
   - Grafana Dashboard with metrics
3. Commit the updated `README.md` to your GitHub repo.

Would you like me to generate this file as a downloadable `README.md` and image upload placeholders?
